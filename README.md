# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I wanted a way to keep track of my notes and create a way to study what I have learned in this bootcamp. I built this project to keep my notes in an organized fashion and to help boot camp students going through the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned the basics of building a website and the gitflow process.
