# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted a way to keep track of my notes and create a way to study what I have learned in this bootcamp. I built this project to keep my notes in an organized fashion and to help boot camp students going through the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned the basics of building a website and the gitflow process.
